## Reflection

This project was created as a freelancing project aimed at offering local pizza companies an updated site desing. I wanted to create a site that utilized services like door dash for placing orders to save companies money rather than paying for the use of multiple services. This site accomplishes that in offering all of the information a customer may be seeking and then routing directly to the door dash ordering portal. 

This project features some javascript animations that I really enjoyed making and adding to my codepen. This project is built with React and React-Router.
